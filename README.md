# Space-Game
A 2D Multiplayer Space Game I made for my third year project. This was supposed to emulate games like Sea of Thieves though specifically this is inspired by the game Barotrauma.

Command a spaceship with your friends, complete missions to further upgrade your spaceship's functionality.

If running localy, create a server on the chosen port. Anyone connecting to the server simply has to enter the correct port number.
For the address use the networks private ip address.

For Online play make sure to open the port you intend to run the server on prior to creating the server.
Anyone joining the server should use the correct port number and public ip address of the server.
